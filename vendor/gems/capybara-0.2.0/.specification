  Capybara aims to simplify the process of integration testing Rack applications,
  such as Rails, Sinatra or Merb. It is inspired by and aims to replace Webrat as
  a DSL for interacting with a webapplication. It is agnostic about the driver
  running your tests and currently comes bundled with rack-test, Culerity and
  Selenium support built in.
