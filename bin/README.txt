Taken from the Rails 4.0 executable output:

  Looks like your app's ./bin/rails is a stub that was generated by Bundler.

  In Rails 4, your app's bin/ directory contains executables that are versioned
  like any other source code, rather than stubs that are generated on demand.

  Here's how to upgrade:

    bundle config --delete bin    # Turn off Bundler's stub generator
    rake rails:update:bin         # Use the new Rails 4 executables
    git add bin                   # Add bin/ to source control

  You may need to remove bin/ from your .gitignore as well.

  When you install a gem whose executable you want to use in your app,
  generate it and add it to source control:

    bundle binstubs some-gem-name
    git add bin/new-executable
