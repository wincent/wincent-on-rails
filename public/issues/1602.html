<p><a href="/issues/1598">Ticket #1598</a> describes the new recursive &quot;best score&quot; algorithm that was recently implemented, but it is a na&#x00ef;ve implementation with no explicit optimization attempted.</p>
<p>This ticket is for recording ideas for improving the performance under the new algorithm:</p>
<h2>Idea 1: do a full &quot;pre-match&quot; before trying recursion</h2>
<p>Complete a full pass to confirm we definitely have a match before doing another recursive pass. In this way we don't waste time recursing through possibilities that will never end up being a match.</p>
<p>Note that this &quot;pre-match&quot; pass can be ultra-quick (no scoring, just a blind left-to-right match, and can probably skip most of the dot-file logic too).</p>
<p>So it is spending more time up-front doing work that might end up saving us a lot more work otherwise. It remains to be seen whether the overall effect will be a net gain.</p>
<p>For pathological cases it is easy to see that it will bring a benefit; eg. given search string &quot;ax&quot; and path <code>aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaax</code>, we end up matching at every single position because we recurse to see if we can find a better score (and incidentally, we don't). If we do the same with a path like <code>aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay</code> we will never find the desired <code>x</code> and will have done the same amount of futile recursion, for nothing.</p>
<p>Depending on the number and composition of paths in a directory, and the nature of the search string, this kind of futile recursion could either be very frequent or not common at all.</p>
<h2>Idea 2: do depth-first rather than breadth-first recursion</h2>
<p>This is a variation of idea 1, with the idea being to avoid wasting time searching the &quot;match space&quot; of paths which will never actually end up being complete matches.</p>
<p>In this variant, instead of recursing in order to bump our search one char to the right and seek a better match, we recurse in order to try the next character in the search string.</p>
<p>So, given a search string like &quot;abcd&quot;, we:</p>
<ul>
<li>scan until we find an &quot;a&quot;</li>
</ul>
<pre>* recurse to find &quot;b&quot;
 * recurse to find &quot;c&quot;
  * recurse to find &quot;d&quot;: at this point we have a guaranteed match, so we return
 * recursion returned a match, bump one char right and see if we can find a better one
  * recurse looking for better match
 * if recursion returned a better match, record it, keep bumping right until we run out of room
* recursion returned its best match, bump right and check for better scores etc</pre>
<ul>
<li>recursion returned its best match, bump right and check for better scores etc</li>
</ul>
<p>So given a really long search string we are still going to potentially recurse to a fairly low depth (20 character search string means up to 20 levels of recursion), and this is not going to be as fast as an inline scan for a match, but it will saved us from doing lots of futile recursion on strings that will never match.</p>
<h2>Idea 3: use a heuristic to determine when to give up early</h2>
<p>I'm doubtful that this one will work, to be honest, but I'll mention it anyway. Given the example search string of &quot;ax&quot; and path <code>aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaax</code>, it is fairly easy to see that the first match for <code>a</code> is going to be the best one that we'll ever get and trying the others is pointless.</p>
<p>It actually wouldn't be too hard to do an inline check for this kind of thing; ie: find <code>a</code>, and then keep scanning anyway to see if there is a later <code>a</code> with a higher score.</p>
<p>The problem with this approach is that we can only really &quot;look ahead&quot; one character at a time and that won't help us to discern between scorings like this:</p>
<pre>a..............articles
^               ^^^^^^^
a..............articles
               ^^^^^^^^</pre>
<p>Here if we search for &quot;articles&quot;, we'll see the first <code>a</code> and when we look for a better one we'll find that the second <code>a</code> has a lower score. If we decide not to pursue that alternative path because that one character has a lower score, then we prematurely discard the possibility of matching a high-scoring run of &quot;articles&quot;, which may actually give us a better score.</p>
