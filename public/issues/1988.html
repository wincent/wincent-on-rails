Git v1.7.11.2 Release Notes
===========================

Fixes since v1.7.11.1
---------------------

* On Cygwin, the platform pread(2) is not thread safe, just like our
  own compat/ emulation, and cannot be used in the index-pack
  program.  Makefile variable NO_THREAD_SAFE_PREAD can be defined to
  avoid use of this function in a threaded program.

* &quot;git add&quot; allows adding a regular file to the path where a
  submodule used to exist, but &quot;git update-index&quot; does not allow an
  equivalent operation to Porcelain writers.

* &quot;git archive&quot; incorrectly computed the header checksum; the symptom
  was observed only when using pathnames with hi-bit set.

* &quot;git blame&quot; did not try to make sure that the abbreviated commit
  object names in its output are unique.

* Running &quot;git bundle verify&quot; on a bundle that records a complete
  history said &quot;it requires these 0 commits&quot;.

* &quot;git clone --single-branch&quot; to clone a single branch did not limit
  the cloning to the specified branch.

* &quot;git diff --no-index&quot; did not correctly handle relative paths and
  did not correctly give exit codes when run under &quot;--quiet&quot; option.

* &quot;git diff --no-index&quot; did not work with pagers correctly.

* &quot;git diff COPYING HEAD:COPYING&quot; gave a nonsense error message that
  claimed that the treeish HEAD did not have COPYING in it.

* When &quot;git log&quot; gets &quot;--simplify-merges/by-decoration&quot; together with
  &quot;--first-parent&quot;, the combination of these options makes the
  simplification logic to use in-core commit objects that haven't
  been examined for relevance, either producing incorrect result or
  taking too long to produce any output.  Teach the simplification
  logic to ignore commits that the first-parent traversal logic
  ignored when both are in effect to work around the issue.

* &quot;git ls-files --exclude=t -i&quot; did not consider anything under t/ as
  excluded, as it did not pay attention to exclusion of leading paths
  while walking the index.  Other two users of excluded() are also
  updated.

* &quot;git request-pull $url dev&quot; when the tip of &quot;dev&quot; branch was tagged
  with &quot;ext4-for-linus&quot; used the contents from the tag in the output
  but still asked the &quot;dev&quot; branch to be pulled, not the tag.

Also contains minor typofixes and documentation updates.

----------------------------------------------------------------

Changes since v1.7.11.1 are as follows:

Carlos Mart&#x00ed;n Nieto (2):
     Documentation: --no-walk is no-op if range is specified

     ls-files -i: pay attention to exclusion of leading paths
     ls-files -i: micro-optimize path_excluded()
     tweak &quot;bundle verify&quot; of a complete history
     path_excluded(): update API to less cache-entry centric
     builtin/add.c: use path_excluded()
     unpack-trees.c: use path_excluded() in check_ok_to_remove()
     dir.c: make excluded() file scope static
     revision: &quot;simplify&quot; options imply topo-order sort
     revision: note the lack of free() in simplify_merges()
     archive: ustar header checksum is computed unsigned
     revision: ignore side parents while running simplify-merges
     index-pack: Disable threading on cygwin
     blame: compute abbreviation width that ensures uniqueness
     Git 1.7.11.2

Leila Muhtasib (1):
     Documentation: Fix misspellings

Matthieu Moy (2):
     sha1_name: do not trigger detailed diagnosis for file arguments
     verify_filename(): ask the caller to chose the kind of diagnosis

Micha&#x0142; G&#x00f3;rny (1):
     git-submodule.sh: fix filename in comment.

Nguy&#x1ec5;n Th&#x00e1;i Ng&#x1ecd;c Duy (1):
     clone: fix ref selection in --single-branch --branch=xxx

Peter Krefting (1):
     Update Swedish translation (1066t0f0u)

Thomas Badie (1):
     git-add--interactive.perl: Remove two unused variables

Tim Henigan (1):
     diff-no-index: exit(1) if 'diff --quiet &lt;repo file&gt; &lt;external file&gt;' finds changes

Git v1.7.11.3 Release Notes
===========================

Fixes since v1.7.11.3
---------------------

* The error message from &quot;git push $there :bogo&quot; (and its equivalent
  &quot;git push $there --delete bogo&quot;) mentioned that we tried and failed
  to guess what ref is being deleted based on the LHS of the refspec,
  which we don't.

* A handful of files and directories we create had tighter than
  necessary permission bits when the user wanted to have group
  writability (e.g. by setting &quot;umask 002&quot;).

* &quot;commit --amend&quot; used to refuse amending a commit with an empty log
  message, with or without &quot;--allow-empty-message&quot;.

* &quot;git commit --amend --only --&quot; was meant to allow &quot;Clever&quot; people to
  rewrite the commit message without making any change even when they
  have already changes for the next commit added to their index, but
  it never worked as advertised since it was introduced in 1.3.0 era.

* Even though the index can record pathnames longer than 1&lt;&lt;12 bytes,
  in some places we were not comparing them in full, potentially
  replacing index entries instead of adding.

* &quot;git show&quot;'s auto-walking behaviour was an unreliable and
  unpredictable hack; it now behaves just like &quot;git log&quot; does when it
  walks.

* &quot;git diff&quot;, &quot;git status&quot; and anything that internally uses the
  comparison machinery was utterly broken when the difference
  involved a file with &quot;-&quot; as its name.  This was due to the way &quot;git
  diff --no-index&quot; was incorrectly bolted on to the system, making
  any comparison that involves a file &quot;-&quot; at the root level
  incorrectly read from the standard input.

* We did not have test to make sure &quot;git rebase&quot; without extra options
  filters out an empty commit in the original history.

* &quot;git fast-export&quot; produced an input stream for fast-import without
  properly quoting pathnames when they contain SPs in them.

* &quot;git checkout --detach&quot;, when you are still on an unborn branch,
  should be forbidden, but it wasn't.

* Some implementations of Perl terminates &quot;lines&quot; with CRLF even when
  the script is operating on just a sequence of bytes.  Make sure to
  use &quot;$PERL_PATH&quot;, the version of Perl the user told Git to use, in
  our tests to avoid unnecessary breakages in tests.

Also contains minor typofixes and documentation updates.

----------------------------------------------------------------

Changes since v1.7.11.2 are as follows:

Alex Riesen (1):
     Restore umasks influence on the permissions of work tree created by clone

Chris Webb (2):
     git-checkout: disallow --detach on unborn branch

     rerere: make rr-cache fanout directory honor umask
     cache_name_compare(): do not truncate while comparing paths
     Git 1.7.11.3

Git v1.7.11.5 Release Notes
===========================

Fixes since v1.7.11.4
---------------------

* The Makefile rule to create assembly output (primarily for
  debugging purposes) did not create it next to the source.

* The code to avoid mistaken attempt to add the object directory
  itself as its own alternate could read beyond end of a string while
  comparison.

* On some architectures, &quot;block-sha1&quot; did not compile correctly
  when compilers inferred alignment guarantees from our source we
  did not intend to make.

* When talking to a remote running ssh on IPv6 enabled host, whose
  address is spelled as &quot;[HOST]:PORT&quot;, we did not parse the address
  correctly and failed to connect.

* git-blame.el (in compat/) have been updated to use Elisp more
  correctly.

* &quot;git checkout &lt;branchname&gt;&quot; to come back from a detached HEAD state
  incorrectly computed reachability of the detached HEAD, resulting
  in unnecessary warnings.

* &quot;git mergetool&quot; did not support --tool-help option to give the list
  of supported backends, like &quot;git difftool&quot; does.

* &quot;git grep&quot; stopped spawning an external &quot;grep&quot; long time ago, but a
  duplicated test to check internal and external &quot;grep&quot; was left
  behind.

Also contains minor typofixes and documentation updates.

----------------------------------------------------------------

Heiko Voigt (1):

Git v1.7.12 Release Notes
=========================

Updates since v1.7.11
---------------------

UI, Workflows &amp; Features

* Git can be told to normalize pathnames it read from readdir(3) and
  all arguments it got from the command line into precomposed UTF-8
  (assuming that they come as decomposed UTF-8), in order to work
  around issues on Mac OS.

  I think there still are other places that need conversion
  (e.g. paths that are read from stdin for some commands), but this
  should be a good first step in the right direction.

* Per-user $HOME/.gitconfig file can optionally be stored in
  $HOME/.config/git/config instead, which is in line with XDG.

* The value of core.attributesfile and core.excludesfile default to
  $HOME/.config/git/attributes and $HOME/.config/git/ignore respectively
  when these files exist.

* Logic to disambiguate abbreviated object names have been taught to
  take advantage of object types that are expected in the context,
  e.g. XXXXXX in the &quot;git describe&quot; output v1.2.3-gXXXXXX must be a
  commit object, not a blob nor a tree.  This will help us prolong
  the lifetime of abbreviated object names.

* &quot;git apply&quot; learned to wiggle the base version and perform three-way
  merge when a patch does not exactly apply to the version you have.

* Scripted Porcelain writers now have access to the credential API via
  the &quot;git credential&quot; plumbing command.

* &quot;git help&quot; used to always default to &quot;man&quot; format even on platforms
  where &quot;man&quot; viewer is not widely available.

* &quot;git clone --local $path&quot; started its life as an experiment to
  optionally use link/copy when cloning a repository on the disk, but
  we didn't deprecate it after we made the option a no-op to always
  use the optimization.  The command learned &quot;--no-local&quot; option to
  turn this off, as a more explicit alternative over use of file://
  URL.

* &quot;git fetch&quot; and friends used to say &quot;remote side hung up
  unexpectedly&quot; when they failed to get response they expect from the
  other side, but one common reason why they don't get expected
  response is that the remote repository does not exist or cannot be
  read. The error message in this case was updated to give better
  hints to the user.

* &quot;git help -w $cmd&quot; can show HTML version of documentation for
  &quot;git-$cmd&quot; by setting help.htmlpath to somewhere other than the
  default location where the build procedure installs them locally;
  the variable can even point at a http:// URL.

* &quot;git rebase [-i] --root $tip&quot; can now be used to rewrite all the
  history leading to &quot;$tip&quot; down to the root commit.

* &quot;git rebase -i&quot; learned &quot;-x &lt;cmd&gt;&quot; to insert &quot;exec &lt;cmd&gt;&quot; after
  each commit in the resulting history.

* &quot;git status&quot; gives finer classification to various states of paths
  in conflicted state and offer advice messages in its output.

* &quot;git submodule&quot; learned to deal with nested submodule structure
  where a module is contained within a module whose origin is
  specified as a relative URL to its superproject's origin.

* A rather heavy-ish &quot;git completion&quot; script has been split to create
  a separate &quot;git prompting&quot; script, to help lazy-autoloading of the
  completion part while making prompting part always available.

* &quot;gitweb&quot; pays attention to various forms of credits that are
  similar to &quot;Signed-off-by:&quot; lines in the commit objects and
  highlights them accordingly.


Foreign Interface

* &quot;mediawiki&quot; remote helper (in contrib/) learned to handle file
  attachments.

* &quot;git p4&quot; now uses &quot;Jobs:&quot; and &quot;p4 move&quot; when appropriate.

* vcs-svn has been updated to clean-up compilation, lift 32-bit
  limitations, etc.


Performance, Internal Implementation, etc. (please report possible regressions)

* Some tests showed false failures caused by a bug in ecryptofs.

* We no longer use AsciiDoc7 syntax in our documentation and favor a
  more modern style.

* &quot;git am --rebasing&quot; codepath was taught to grab authorship, log
  message and the patch text directly out of existing commits.  This
  will help rebasing commits that have confusing &quot;diff&quot; output in
  their log messages.

* &quot;git index-pack&quot; and &quot;git pack-objects&quot; use streaming API to read
  from the object store to avoid having to hold a large blob object
  in-core while they are doing their thing.

* Code to match paths with exclude patterns learned to avoid calling
  fnmatch() by comparing fixed leading substring literally when
  possible.

* &quot;git log -n 1 -- rarely-touched-path&quot; was spending unnecessary
  cycles after showing the first change to find the next one, only to
  discard it.

* &quot;git svn&quot; got a large-looking code reorganization at the last
  minute before the code freeze.


Also contains minor documentation updates and code clean-ups.


Fixes since v1.7.11
-------------------

Unless otherwise noted, all the fixes since v1.7.11 in the maintenance
releases are contained in this release (see release notes to them for
details).

* &quot;git submodule add&quot; was confused when the superproject did not have
  its repository in its usual place in the working tree and GIT_DIR
  and GIT_WORK_TREE was used to access it.

* &quot;git commit --amend&quot; let the user edit the log message and then died
  when the human-readable committer name was given insufficiently by
  getpwent(3).</pre>

Git 1.7.12.1 Release Notes
==========================

Fixes since v1.7.12
-------------------

* &quot;git apply -p0&quot; did not parse pathnames on &quot;diff --git&quot; line
  correctly.  This caused patches that had pathnames in no other
  places to be mistakenly rejected (most notably, binary patch that
  does not rename nor change mode).  Textual patches, renames or mode
  changes have preimage and postimage pathnames in different places
  in a form that can be parsed unambiguously and did not suffer from
  this problem.

* &quot;git cherry-pick A C B&quot; used to replay changes in A and then B and
  then C if these three commits had committer timestamps in that
  order, which is not what the user who said &quot;A C B&quot; naturally
  expects.

* &quot;git commit --amend&quot; let the user edit the log message and then
  died when the human-readable committer name was given
  insufficiently by getpwent(3).

* Some capabilities were asked by fetch-pack even when upload-pack
  did not advertise that they are available.  fetch-pack has been
  fixed not to do so.

* &quot;git diff&quot; had a confusion between taking data from a path in the
  working tree and taking data from an object that happens to have
  name 0{40} recorded in a tree.

* &quot;git for-each-ref&quot; did not correctly support more than one --sort
  option.

* &quot;git log ..&quot; errored out saying it is both rev range and a path
  when there is no disambiguating &quot;--&quot; is on the command line.
  Update the command line parser to interpret &quot;..&quot; as a path in such
  a case.

* The &quot;--topo-order&quot;, &quot;--date-order&quot; (and the lack of either means
  the default order) options to &quot;rev-list&quot; and &quot;log&quot; family of
  commands were poorly described in the documentation.

* &quot;git prune&quot; without &quot;-v&quot; used to warn about leftover temporary
  files (which is an indication of an earlier aborted operation).

* Pushing to smart HTTP server with recent Git fails without having
  the username in the URL to force authentication, if the server is
  configured to allow GET anonymously, while requiring authentication
  for POST.

* The reflog entries left by &quot;git rebase&quot; and &quot;git rebase -i&quot; were
  inconsistent (the interactive one gave an abbreviated object name).

* When &quot;git push&quot; triggered the automatic gc on the receiving end, a
  message from &quot;git prune&quot; that said it was removing cruft leaked to
  the standard output, breaking the communication protocol.

* &quot;git show --quiet&quot; ought to be a synonym for &quot;git show -s&quot;, but
  wasn't.

* &quot;git show --format='%ci'&quot; did not give timestamp correctly for
  commits created without human readable name on &quot;committer&quot; line.

* &quot;git send-email&quot; did not unquote encoded words that appear on the
  header correctly, and lost &quot;_&quot; from strings.

* The interactive prompt &quot;git send-email&quot; gives was error prone. It
  asked &quot;What e-mail address do you want to use?&quot; with the address it
  guessed (correctly) the user would want to use in its prompt,
  tempting the user to say &quot;y&quot;. But the response was taken as &quot;No,
  please use 'y' as the e-mail address instead&quot;, which is most
  certainly not what the user meant.

* &quot;gitweb&quot; when used with PATH_INFO failed to notice directories with
  SP (and other characters that need URL-style quoting) in them.

* When the user gives an argument that can be taken as both a
  revision name and a pathname without disambiguating with &quot;--&quot;, we
  used to give a help message &quot;Use '--' to separate&quot;.  The message
  has been clarified to show where that '--' goes on the command
  line.

* When the user exports a non-default IFS without HT, scripts that
  rely on being able to parse &quot;ls-files -s | while read a b c...&quot;
  started to fail.  Protect them from such a misconfiguration.

* The attribute system may be asked for a path that itself or its
  leading directories no longer exists in the working tree, and it is
  fine if we cannot open .gitattribute file in such a case.  Failure
  to open per-directory .gitattributes with error status other than
  ENOENT and ENOTDIR should be diagnosed, but it wasn't.

* After &quot;gitk&quot; showed the contents of a tag, neither &quot;Reread
  references&quot; nor &quot;Reload&quot; did not update what is shown as the
  contents of it, when the user overwrote the tag with &quot;git tag -f&quot;.

* &quot;ciabot&quot; script (in contrib/) has been updated with extensive
  documentation.

* &quot;git-jump&quot; script (in contrib/) did not work well when
  diff.noprefix or diff.mnemonicprefix is in effect.

* Older parts of the documentation described as if having a regular
  file in .git/refs/ hierarchy were the only way to have branches and
  tags, which is not true for quite some time.

* A utility shell function test_seq has been added as a replacement
  for the 'seq' utility found on some platforms.

* Compatibility wrapper to learn the maximum number of file
  descriptors we can open around sysconf(_SC_OPEN_MAX) and
  getrlimit(RLIMIT_NO_FILE) has been introduced for portability.

* We used curl_easy_strerror() without checking version of cURL,
  breaking the build for versions before curl 7.12.0.

* Code to work around MacOS X UTF-8 gotcha has been cleaned up.

* Fallback 'getpass' implementation made unportable use of stdio API.

* The &quot;--rebase&quot; option to &quot;git pull&quot; can be abbreviated to &quot;-r&quot;,
  but we didn't document it.

* It was generally understood that &quot;--long-option&quot;s to many of our
  subcommands can be abbreviated to the unique prefix, but it was not
  easy to find it described for new readers of the documentation set.

* The synopsis said &quot;checkout [-B branch]&quot; to make it clear the
  branch name is a parameter to the option, but the heading for the
  option description was &quot;-B::&quot;, not &quot;-B branch::&quot;, making the
  documentation misleading.

Also contains numerous documentation updates.

Git 1.7.12.2 Release Notes
==========================

Fixes since v1.7.12.1
---------------------

* When &quot;git am&quot; is fed an input that has multiple &quot;Content-type: ...&quot;
  header, it did not grok charset= attribute correctly.

* Even during a conflicted merge, &quot;git blame $path&quot; always meant to
  blame uncommitted changes to the &quot;working tree&quot; version; make it
  more useful by showing cleanly merged parts as coming from the other
  branch that is being merged.

* &quot;git blame MAKEFILE&quot; run in a history that has &quot;Makefile&quot; but not
  &quot;MAKEFILE&quot; should say &quot;No such file MAKEFILE in HEAD&quot;, but got
  confused on a case insensitive filesystem and failed to do so.

* &quot;git fetch --all&quot;, when passed &quot;--no-tags&quot;, did not honor the
  &quot;--no-tags&quot; option while fetching from individual remotes (the same
  issue existed with &quot;--tags&quot;, but combination &quot;--all --tags&quot; makes
  much less sense than &quot;--all --no-tags&quot;).

* &quot;git log/diff/format-patch --stat&quot; showed the &quot;N line(s) added&quot;
  comment in user's locale and caused careless submitters to send
  patches with such a line in them to projects whose project language
  is not their language, mildly irritating others. Localization to
  the line has been disabled for now.

* &quot;git log --all-match --grep=A --grep=B&quot; ought to show commits that
  mention both A and B, but when these three options are used with
  --author or --committer, it showed commits that mention either A or
  B (or both) instead.

* The subcommand to remove the definition of a remote in &quot;git remote&quot;
  was named &quot;rm&quot; even though all other subcommands were spelled out.
  Introduce &quot;git remote remove&quot; to remove confusion, and keep &quot;rm&quot; as
  a backward compatible synonym.

Also contains a handful of documentation updates.

Git 1.7.12.3 Release Notes
==========================

Fixes since v1.7.12.2
---------------------

* &quot;git am&quot; mishandled a patch attached as application/octet-stream
  (e.g. not text/*); Content-Transfer-Encoding (e.g. base64) was not
  honored correctly.

* It was unclear in the documentation for &quot;git blame&quot; that it is
  unnecessary for users to use the &quot;--follow&quot; option.

* A repository created with &quot;git clone --single&quot; had its fetch
  refspecs set up just like a clone without &quot;--single&quot;, leading the
  subsequent &quot;git fetch&quot; to slurp all the other branches, defeating
  the whole point of specifying &quot;only this branch&quot;.

* &quot;git fetch&quot; over http had an old workaround for an unlikely server
  misconfiguration; it turns out that this hurts debuggability of the
  configuration in general, and has been reverted.

* &quot;git fetch&quot; over http advertised that it supports &quot;deflate&quot;, which
  is much less common, and did not advertise the more common &quot;gzip&quot; on
  its Accept-Encoding header.

* &quot;git receive-pack&quot; (the counterpart to &quot;git push&quot;) did not give
  progress output while processing objects it received to the puser
  when run over the smart-http protocol.

* &quot;git status&quot; honored the ignore=dirty settings in .gitmodules but
  &quot;git commit&quot; didn't.

Also contains a handful of documentation updates.
