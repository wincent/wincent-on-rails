<div class='issue-description-body'>
<p>Has the idea of auto-switch to the login window when a user has been idle been considered?</p>
<p>I would love to know that if I walked away from my computer, it would switch to the login window x minutes later.... </p>
<p>this would be an ideal feature for security reasons. I could leave the computer, and if i forgot to hit the login window keystroke, I would know that after x minutes, my computer would auto-switch to the login window. </p>
<p>this is better than auto-logout, and more secure than the password protected screen saver option.</p>

<p>What makes you think this is more secure than the password protected screen saver? There was a publicized security glitch in the screen saver a long time ago, but that's long since been fixed.</p>

<p>Because any admin user of my computer can gain access to my account if I am logged in &amp; there is just the screen saver going.</p>

<p>yes, but with my machine already at the login screen, they would not have to &quot;walk through my office&quot; just to get to theirs.</p>
<p>At any rate, I founds the software I need: <a href="http://lorenb.com/software/ciao/" class="external">http://lorenb.com/software/ciao/</a></p>
<p>so if this feature does make it into WinSwitch, great. If not, WinSwitch is still wonderful in and of itself!</p>

<p>of course that is not the case.  </p>
<p>This request had two parts:  my case where I simply wanted my machine to go to the login screen. and the case of one of my clients:</p>
<p>office computer for use by 3-4 people at a time, none of which are admin users.</p>
<p>If one person forgets to logout, a forced logout could result in lost data, and a locked screen saver prevents other users from using the computer.</p>
<p>in this case, the machine is already at the login screen, so others can use the computer without interrupting the one who has stepped away.</p>

<p>Ah, ok. This is the first time you've mentioned this second motive. All of your other comments have been about security.  And ironically the two motives aren't entirely compatible; on the one hand you want automatic logout for security reasons, on the other you don't want to do forced log-outs. But if you choose to do a non-forced log-out, this can be blocked by an application running in the user account; if the machine can't log-out within 120 seconds it will stop trying and show a dialog and in that case you have no security at all, not even illusory security!</p>

<p>True, because my security concerns were still on my mind. Also, I am not thinking security against attackers, just from the eyes of co-workers or family members.  Two very different levels of security indeed.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>no, not logout. Switch to the login window while leaving the user logged in. Two very different needs indeed.</p>

<p>Right, that is why a switch to the login window is superior.</p>

<p>Doh. This whole time I've been reading this as &quot;log out&quot;, not &quot;switch to login screen&quot;... Probably because yesterday I implemented feature <a href="/issues/332">request #332</a> and have &quot;log out&quot; on the brain.</p>

<blockquote><p>I'm marking all WinSwitch issues closed seeing as I personally no longer use it, and in fact haven't for around 4 years now.</p>
<p>WinSwitch addressed a real problem with the initial implementation of Fast User Switching in <a href="/wiki/Panther">Panther</a> (released October 2003), namely, the excessive screen real estate that it chewed up. Apple fixed that problem in Tiger, if I recall correctly, which came out in April 2005 (or if I'm wrong about it being <a href="/wiki/Tiger">Tiger</a>, then it was definitely fixed by the time <a href="/wiki/Leopard">Leopard</a> came out, in October 2007).</p>
<p>With this change, most of the justification for WinSwitch's existence went away, at least for me. So that's why I'm going to close all these tickets: I can't really support something that I don't use myself.</p>
<p>But it's open source (see <a href="http://git.wincent.com/WinSwitch.git" class="external">http://git.wincent.com/WinSwitch.git</a>), so if any one wants to tackle any of these issues and submit patches, I'll be happy to accept them.</p>
