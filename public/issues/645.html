<div class='issue-description-body'>
<p>I took all the current Software Updates (including iTunes) today and rebooted. Synergy didn't show up in my menu bar, and my keyboard shortcuts don't work.</p>
<p>I reinstalled 3.2, and observed that I could Start Synergy from System Preferences, but not Stop it. I removed and added the startup item from Synergy's prefpane too. Further, I could kill it with &quot;killall Synergy&quot;, but this had no visible effect (except that the next time there were no matches to kill). Since the upgrade, ATSServer is dying a lot, but other apps are coping.</p>
<p>This is 10.5.1 on a Mac Pro.</p>
<p>In addition, iTunes 7.6 (20) reset my Library to factory defaults (empty; stock playlists only)</p>
