<blockquote><p>With the addition of Growl support in Synergy, I am curious to know how many users are using Growl. My suspicion is that as a percentage it is a small but nevertheless significant minority. I suspect this because on the one hand Growl is still pretty &quot;geeky&quot; and not all that &quot;mainstream&quot; (compared to Synergy itself, which is definitely targeted at the mainstream), but on the other hand, Growl is becoming more and more popular and before implementing support for it I did receive at least five separate requests for it over a period of several months (if five people take the time to write in and ask for support, then it probably means that there are more people out there who would *like* the feature but don't bother to write).</p>
<p>So I present this ultra-scientific poll to find out exactly what percentage of Synergy users actually are using Growl write now.</p>

<blockquote><p>I use Growl, but NOT for Synergy. I much prefer the way that Synergy organizes the information in its status display. I also don't like the fact that the only Growl &quot;skin&quot; that looks similar (Smoke) is stuck in the top right-hand corner - it's nice being able to move the Synergy popup where ever I want.</p>
<p>(note - you might want to reword the question, as I assumed it meant, &quot;Do I use Growl at all&quot;, and not specifically if I use it instead of Synergy's built-in display.)</p>

<p>Yeah, that's what I do mean by the question. Basically I want to know what proportion of Synergy users have Growl installed, regardless of whether they use it in conjunction with Synergy.</p>

<blockquote><p>I have Growl, too, and I also don't use it for Synergy. I use it for Shrook, Mail, and as a generic alert/reporting mechanism for my own Applescripts.</p>

<blockquote><p>I too have Growl! and use it for Fire, SpamSieve, and Synergy (from day one it had support for it).</p>
