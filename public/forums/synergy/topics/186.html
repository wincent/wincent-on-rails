<blockquote><p>No matter how I save my applescript (with or without startup screen) I constantly get this dialogue appearing when the Track Changes items are run:</p>
<pre></pre>
<p>Also, this appears consistently if I assign a rating to a track using Synergy.</p>
<p>Is there any way to stop this dialogue from appearing?</p>
<p>You can view the Applescript I'm running  here.</p>

<blockquote><p>No - it's definitely a bug with the way Synergy runs applescripts as I've definitely saved my script without the startup screen. I also had this issue with the scripts that were included in the last release without opening or altering them in any way.</p>

<blockquote><p>Unfortunately I am not able to reproduce this issue. I don't think it's &quot;a bug with the way Synergy runs AppleScripts&quot;; all Synergy does is tell the Finder to open them (ie. it is equivalent to double-clicking them). What happens when you double-click your scripts manually?</p>
<p>I wonder what the difference is between your set-up and the one of the person who filed <a href="/issues/424">bug #424</a> and who was able to resolve the problem by saving his AppleScript with the appropriate settings...</p>

<blockquote><p>I can't reproduce this issue by manually running the script, even after dozens of tries. That's what makes me wonder if there's something specific about how Synergy runs the scripts themselves.</p>
<p>That said, it would be much better if Synergy didn't require the scripts to be compiled as applications... </p>

<blockquote><p>Hello all - I just had to do a system re-install, and had to re-install synergy as well.  In doing so, I stumbled upon the track change items, and installed the auto rate following the instuctions on the PDF.  Made a new folder in Synergy application support called Track Change Items, restarted iTunes and Synergy, and.... nothing happened!  I realize that the PDF specifies that the script is for iTunes 4.7, and I am currently running 6.0.5 - do the track change items no longer work for the current version of iTunes? </p>
<p>THank you for your help!</p>

<p>I haven't tested the track change items lately so I don't know if the sample scripts have any incompatibilities with later versions of iTunes. I can confirm though that the code in Synergy for scanning the track change items folders hasn't changed.</p>
<p>Are you sure your track change items folder is named correctly (ie. correct case) and that's it has appropriate permissions (ie. not world-writable)?</p>

<blockquote><p>Thank you so much for the quick response!  I double checked the folder name: Track Change Items (with the spaces and capitalization).  I switched permissions for the file to read only and re-started everything.  Sadly, no luck.  I still LOVE synergy though!</p>
<p>Thank you</p>

<blockquote><p>Anything printed to the console when tracks change? (Errors, warnings etc.)</p>
<p>Does the script work when you double-click it? (If it doesn't work when you double-click it then it won't work when Synergy tries to launch it either.)</p>

<p>It seems that the Autorate app doesn't work with iTunes anymore, but it's not a problem with Synergy.  We may need to get these applets updated.</p>
