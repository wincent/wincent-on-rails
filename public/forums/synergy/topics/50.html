<blockquote><p>Excellent! I've been wanting this for a long time. Nice to see Synergy now idling at 0.0%. I'm interested in the internal changes to iTunes that enable this - does iTunes now post notifications to OS X's notification service? (I've never looked into this area of OS X, but am I right in assuming it has a notification service and it can be used for this type of thing?) How did you find out about it? I didn't see anything to do with that type of change mentioned in the release notes.</p>
<p>I'm guessing Apple finally decided to add this functionality to iTunes because their iTunes widget in Tiger needs it. It would be a bit of an ugly hack if they had to constantly poll iTunes. (Not saying that Synergy has been an ugly hack until now - far from it, it's just that Apple has the power to implement it more elegantly so it's not surprising they chose to do so.)</p>

<p>Check out this bug report:</p>
<p><a href="http://wincent.com/a/support/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=34" class="external">http://wincent.com/a/support/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=34</a></p>
<p>Two people who are running 10.2.8 have reported it, but I think I've now fixed it. There is a download link in that bug to the new build. I would appreciate it if you could try it out and add comments to the bug.</p>
<p>As for going back to an old version, the last version is still on all the mirrors. Eg:</p>
<p><a href="http://mirror.lavertue.com/synergy/Synergy1.4.dmg" class="external">http://mirror.lavertue.com/synergy/Synergy1.4.dmg</a> <a href="http://wincent.daviddauer.de/Synergy1.4.dmg" class="external">http://wincent.daviddauer.de/Synergy1.4.dmg</a> <a href="ftp://ftp.sunwizard.net/mirrors/wincent/Synergy1.4.dmg" class="external">ftp://ftp.sunwizard.net/mirrors/wincent/Synergy1.4.dmg</a> <a href="http://mirror.overengineers.com/Synergy1.4.dmg" class="external">http://mirror.overengineers.com/Synergy1.4.dmg</a> <a href="http://www.gritsch-soft.com/~winswitch/Synergy1.4.dmg" class="external">http://www.gritsch-soft.com/~winswitch/Synergy1.4.dmg</a></p>

<p>It's called NSDistributedNotificationCenter. If you look at the WinSwitch source code you can see the kind of reverse engineering one needs to do to figure out these things (thankfully, not too much!).</p>

<p>I think you're dead right. I also think they're using it for the iChat/iTunes integration in Tiger. Needless to say, I'll be taking full advantage of all this for Synergy Advance, which will include Dashboard support.</p>
<p>And as for &quot;ugly hacks&quot;, well, it wasn't an ugly hack, but it was a kludge. I am very glad to be rid of it. And from the feedback, the users love the increased performance. Next version should have even more performance. In fixing the 10.2.8 bug I've already cut remaining communications with iTunes in half again.</p>

<p>Great!</p>

<p>That's good to hear. I'm really curious what you have up your sleeve for SA. Looking forward to the first release.</p>

<blockquote><p>I have been having stability problems with my copy of 1.5b, it only occurs when synergy/iTunes sit idle overnight (when I go home from work). When I come in in the morning, both Synergy and iTunes are hung, and require a force quit/kill. I am using a dual 2.0 G5. Is there any debug info that I can submit to help trace the bug?</p>

<p>There certainly is. Check out  this article I wrote on how to file a useful bug report and then head over to the  bug tracking database...</p>
<p>Thanks for the collaboration!</p>
