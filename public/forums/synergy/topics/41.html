<blockquote><p>I recently discovered Audioscobbler.com: Quote: Audioscrobbler builds a profile of your musical taste using a plugin for your media player (Winamp, iTunes, XMMS etc..). Plugins send the name of every song you play to the Audioscrobbler server, which updates your musical profile with the new song. Every person with a plugin has their own page on this site which shows their listening statistics. The system automatically matches you to people with a similar music taste, and generates personalised recommendations.</p>
<p>There is a &quot;plugin&quot; for iTunes: it's actually a small (somewhat ugly) application (which displays as a menu extra) which polls iTunes via AppleScript every 10 seconds and sends the current song to Audioscobbler when it has been played more that 50% through. Since Synergy already has the information about the current song, I thought it would be nice to have an option in the Synergy prefs to enable Audioscobbler support. It would eliminate one menu extra from my already overflowing menu bar and one process polling iTunes.  Also, I'm pretty sure that Wincent would come up with a much nicer UI. Lastly, it would probably add a bunch of new users to Audioscobbler, which helps to built up a better database of everyones musical taste.</p>
<p>I've allowed me to submit a feature request into the bug system, so that it won't get lost. Feel free to close it if you think this is a silly idea. </p>
<p>Anyway, I would very much like to hear your opinions.</p>
