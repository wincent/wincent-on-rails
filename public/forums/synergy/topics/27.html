<blockquote><p>I just found this app, and I am enjoying it so far, but I have one problem. Like others who have posted here, I don't really understand the thinking when it comes to the artwork. I have scanned the artwork for all the CD I have imported into iTunes, and ( unless I have missed something here ) they are now imbedded into the file. Synergy pulls that inage from the file and saves it  again as a .tiff file in another folder. I like haveing the artwork displayed with the song/album info, but with a powerbooks limited storage, I cannot afford to have this redundancy. Is there no way to disable the save of the artwork in to Synergy's folder, while still displaying it?</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<blockquote><p>This is a historical legacy that stems from the fact that Synergy had artwork support before Apple ever released iTunes 4 (the first version which allowed you to embed artwork).</p>
<p>So all that caching thing was Synergy's way of dealing with it before iTunes 4 came along. When iTunes 4 did arrive Synergy added the ability to take art from iTunes, but it continued using the cache because that was the &quot;engine&quot; of the whole cover art support.</p>
<p>Synergy Advance doesn't have to work with this historical baggage, because it's a completely new product. You'll see some nifty features related to album art when Synergy Advance gets released...</p>
