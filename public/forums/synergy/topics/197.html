<blockquote><p>Hello,</p>
<p>The problem I'm having with Synergy is that after I quit the iTunes application, it is automatically relaunched after a few seconds. If I turn off Synergy and try to quit iTunes, the auto relaunch does not happen. So I'm pretty sure it's Synergy, not iTunes; besides, this bug started to occur right after I upgraded for 3.1. I am a purchaed user of the program and using a few hot keys to play/pause and skip tracks. Currently I'm using an intel-based mac book. </p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

<blockquote><p>Nope.  I've tried pretty much everything from the troubleshooting, but nothing's working.</p>
<p>Now I'm more than certain that my issue is caused by the lastest version of Synergy.  Do you have a link I can download the previous version?  I had had absolutely no problem with the product until I downloaded the 3.1.  This bug is starting to get very annoying.  Not to mention it took a very long time to finally get a response from somebody. This IS a great support. </p>

<blockquote><p>So I take it you've been able to reproduce the problem after trashing your preferences? Trying from another user account etc? If so, it really is extremely surprising.</p>
<p>The previous version is no longer on the server but if you contact me privately with your email address I can email you a copy. I really don't think it should make a difference though.</p>
<p>In terms of getting a response to support queries, you can always open a support ticket (in the navigation bar above, &quot;Support&quot; -&gt; &quot;Support tickets&quot;). The usual response time for such tickets is within a few hours, almost always within 24 hours, and in extreme cases (for example, if I am away for the weekend) at most a couple of days. I do read these forums but this thread must have slipped under my radar.</p>

<blockquote><p>I'm not sure if this is related, but I've noticed the same thing: iTunes is relaunching a minute after closing it, but it only happens one time. I hadn't begun to look into it when I stumbled upon this post, looking for something else. At any rate, I noticed these lines in the console log almost exactly one minute after closing iTunes, and seeing it start again:</p>
<p>2007-03-05 16:30:04.138 Synergy[5951] Audioscrobbler: Submission timer fired; will double-check that current track position matches expected value 2007-03-05 16:30:13.400 Synergy[5951] Audioscrobbler: Position does not match (user must have skipped); will not submit to Audioscrobbler</p>
<p>I'll see if that occurs next time it happens as well.</p>
