<blockquote><p>I can't remember if I've asked for this or not, but it would be smashing to have the ability to send recently played tracks from Synergy to the Audioscrobbler service.</p>
<p>It's based on HTTP and looks really straight-forward.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.audioscrobbler.com/development/protocol.php" class="external">http://www.audioscrobbler.com/development/protocol.php</a></p>
<p>This would be very, very cool. For those of you who don't know what Audioscrobbler is, it is a system which tracks the music you play. You can then see a bunch of information about the tracks you've played (most played artists, songs, etc.) as well as share with others what you're listening to. It's open source and not affiliated with any labels or anything nefarious like that.</p>
<p>Audioscrobbler is like what del.icio.us is, except you share your musical tastes rather than bookmarks.</p>
<p>The best thing is that as you build a profile of the music you listen to, it gets synced up with the streaming radio site  last.fm. This site allows you to listen to a personalized playlist with music that the system thinks you will like, based on what you've listened to in the past.</p>
<p>Please, could this be integrated into Synergy?</p>
