<blockquote><p>I'm a registered user of Synergy 1.0 and I'm seeing some weird behavior when also concurrently using Volume Logic demo v1.0.1 in 10.3.4</p>
<p>When iTunes starts up for the first time, with Synergy set to launch at login and to only display controls when iTunes is running, Synergy appears to freeze for around 2 minutes. The floater panel does not appear and clicking on the menu bar icon just results in the spinning wheel. After the 2 minute period, Synergy unfreezes and runs as normal.</p>
<p>If I completely uninstall Volume Logic, Synergy works normally and doesn't exhibit the 2 minute freeze. </p>
<p>I've tried different combinations and sequences of installing/un-installing VL and Synergy but nothing seems to work.</p>
<p>Not a show stopper but rather annoying. Anyone else using both Synergy and Volume Logic?</p>

<blockquote><p>I've heard the same from other users of Volume Logic. I am not sure what it's doing to iTunes' ability to respond to Apple Events.</p>
<p>Synergy Advance won't be affected if iTunes is blocking and not responding to Apple Events, because it's got much better separation between the user interface thread and the other threads in the program. The UI should remain responsive no matter what.</p>

<blockquote><p>I've stumbled across the same problem today. I was trying out some new iTunes plugins. After a few hours trial period I registered Synergy...   I also found Volume Logic and I really like it - I would like to use both, Synergy and VL. If Volume Logic is installed, Synergy will take a 2 minute timeout at iTunes startup - while iTunes is fully functional! It might have something to do with the shareware nag screen of Volume Logic coming up at iTunes startup, but since I'm lacking the technical background knowledge I can't be sure about that. </p>
<p>This is quite annoying - any ideas or suggestions on how to resolve this issue?</p>

<blockquote><p>I just noticed that this problem does not occur when the controls are always visible. This is an acceptable workaround for me.</p>

<blockquote><p>After I registered Volume Logic, the problem disappeared. I think you are right in placing the blame on the shareware reminder screen.</p>
<p>BTW if you are interested in purchasing Volume Logic, you can use the following discount code for a $5 discount. However I'm not sure when it will become invalid so your mileage may vary. Note that this discount code was published in a recent edition of Macworld magazine.</p>
