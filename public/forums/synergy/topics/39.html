<blockquote><p>From the post I just made to wincent.org&#x001b;:</p>
<p>Quote: I'm very pleased to announce the immediate availability of  Synergy version  1.2 for  immediate download (912 Kb). This is a major update to the popular iTunes accessory, incorporating an overhaul of the button set system (button sets are now double-clickable packages in the Finder) as well as many, many bugfixes and enhancements.</p>
<p>August has been a tough month for piracy. Early this month someone mass-distributed their serial number and I've seen a 20-30% drop in the rate of licenses purchased, beginning on the day of the leak. When the app only  costs 5 Euros I don't make a lot of money out of it, and a drop like that can make the difference between paying the bills and not... So if you haven't taken out a license yet but have been thinking of doing so, I hope you really like this release and that you will consider supporting further development by  purchasing a license or making a donation.</p>
<p>And on an unrelated note: I will have limited access to email next week from Tuesday 31 August to Sunday 5 September, so please be patient if you send me an email and are awaiting a reply. I will get back to you, but perhaps not with the usual promptness. One thing you can do to be sure of getting a rapid answer is use the  automated registration recovery system if you have lost your serial number and would like it resent to you, and if you are purchasing Synergy, make sure that your PayPal settings are up-to-date so that your registration information gets sent to your current email address. You might find answers for other queries on the forums.</p>
<p>Once again, I hope you all like this release. Enjoy!</p>
