<blockquote><p>Hello,</p>
<p>I've been using Synergy for a while on an iMac G5 running Tiger. I recently replaced it with a new machine (Mac Mini running Snow Leopard) and installed Synergy on it. </p>
<p>On the old machine, I used option-command-space as the hot key for play/pause, option-command-up arrow for volume up, etc. </p>
<p>On the new machine, the old hot keys all work except for option-command-space -- the Synergy prefs won't let me enter it. (I know that this key combination defaults to showing the Spotlight window, but I have unchecked that in the Keyboard preference pane.)</p>
<p>I wondered if this had something to do with Snow Leopard, so I installed it on another Snow Leopard machine, and it worked fine.</p>
<p>Any ideas of why I can't select this hot key?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<p>Ben</p>

<blockquote><p>Well, that would have been my first idea as well (ie. that the system was intercepting that combination and sending it off to Spotlight before letting any other app &quot;see&quot; it).</p>
<p>Sounds like you've already tried everything that I would have tried. One other thing which I would give a shot is plugging in a different type of keyboard just to see if the results are any different. But really, no idea.</p>

<blockquote><p>Hello,</p>
<p>Thanks for the response. I've done a little more experimentation and come up with more information and a workaround. It looks like for whatever reason, you can't enter option-command-space in Snow Leopard. Maybe, as you say, the system intercepts the Spotlight shortcuts even if you turn them off. But you can enter it in Tiger as I had done on my old iMac. (I was mistaken when I said that it had worked on another Snow Leopard machine -- that machine was Tiger.) So I did the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Installed Synergy 3.4.1 (trial) on a Tiger machine. </li>
<li>Changed the hot keys as desired on that machine. </li>
<li>Copied the org.Wincent.Synergy.plist file from the Tiger machine onto the target (Snow Leopard) machine.</li>
<li>Installed Synergy 3.4.1 on the target machine.</li>
<li>Moved the plist file into the ~\Library\Preferences folder on the target machine, replacing the newly created plist file.</li>
<li>Open the preference pane and confirm that the hot keys are set as desired.</li>
<li>Download and install Synergy 4.5.2. Enter registration info. </li>
</ol>
<p>Done and done.</p>
<p>best</p>
<p>Ben</p>
