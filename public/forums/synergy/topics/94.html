<blockquote><p>For me, Synergy often retrieves incorrect album cover art. There should be a way to &quot;notify&quot; Synergy that it has retrieved the wrong image and have it look for another image. It should delete the incorrect album cover and perhaps keep an id tag of some sort of the wrong cover so that is doesn't download it again. Currently, if it downloads the wrong art, you have to do all the work yourself...find the correct image, download it, goto the album covers folder and replace wrong image. Synergy should be smarter in this respect, maybe even provide you with choices before it downloads the art if it comes across similarly named titles, like iTunes does when looking up album info from CDDB.</p>

<blockquote><p>I agree it should be smarter. Note that you don't have to replace the wrong image though. An easier process is this:</p>
<p>1. Find correct art 2. Drag into iTunes 3. Select &quot;Show album covers folder&quot; from Synergy Global Menu 4. Delete art</p>
<p>In step 3 Synergy will select the art for the currently playing song, so steps 3 and 4 should be very quick. Synergy will use the correct art (from iTunes) the next time it plays the song.</p>
<p>I have some ideas for making this easier on the user, and Synergy Advance will have a much better cover management system.</p>

<blockquote><p>I also have a problem with incorrect artwork. Synergy keeps downloading the image of the new Garbage album for Eric Clapton's Me and Mr Johnson - not the same thing at all I'm sure you'll agree:-) And also many others are wrong.</p>
<p>First of all, why is it doing this? How can it be getting it so wrong?</p>
<p>Then how best to correct it. I have no intention of putting artwork into iTunes directly as that will mean duplicating each image into every mp3 on the same album. One of the main reason for using Synergy is to avoid this.</p>
<p>Suggestions?</p>

<blockquote><p>I would like an option to toggle Amazon image searching independently of toggling iTunes image searching. I would rather have Synergy only show the artwork I have entered into iTunes and not search Amazon at all. I search better with Google, and a lot of of my music isn't on Amazon anyway. I've even been known to scan in my own covers when it's a particularly favorite cover that I can't find on the net. I also don't mind an extra 20-50 k or so in each file in exchange for the convenience of not having to keep track of separate picture files. </p>

<blockquote><p>I tried posting there, but I was confused when I went to that part of the site. It asked me for a username and password and with the combination of that and me not really paying much attention, I thought somehow I was taken to the actual &quot;Bugzilla&quot; site, so I came back here and found this thread (which should also be in the &quot;Bugs And Requested Features&quot; section, no?). Now that I look at it I realize that it's still part of this site. I still don't have a username and password for that part of the site, but since I said what I wanted to say here and someone else has expressed the same idea, I'll leave it at that.</p>
<p>Disclaimer: I am a pretty smart person, but I just don't want to waste a lot of time trying to figure out a web site's layout just to post some feedback. (Just some honest knee jerk consumer-oriented reaction... no offense.   )</p>

<blockquote><p>I know a lot of people are intimidated by Bugzilla (to the point of not even wanting to use it at times), but it's just so darn powerful that it's the software I wanted to use (there's a reason why projects like the Linux kernel and others use it).</p>
<p>But I think you're right. The templates would benefit from customization to make the pages look more like the rest of the site... I will see if I can get that working.</p>
<p>[Update: I have changed the bugzilla templates so that the standard Wincent header and navigation bar appears at the top of every page. The style sheet still needs some tweaking but the major changes have already been made.]</p>
