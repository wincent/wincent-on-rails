<blockquote><p>I've been using Synergy for a year or so, and have always used the floater.  But I decided that I don't want to use it anymore.  The problem is that I can't kill it.  I even went so far as to uninstall Synergy and then search my HD for anything called &quot;synergy,&quot; which I deleted.  I emptied my trash, logged out and back in... and still the floater appears.  This is driving me nuts!  What can I do?</p>

<blockquote><p>Perhaps you've installed a third-party application which displays a floater?</p>
<p>A much easier way to remove Synergy than searching your hard drive is to run the Synergy installer and click &quot;Uninstall&quot;.</p>

<blockquote><p>Nope, this is the only iTunes-related app I've ever installed, and it's most definitely the Synergy floater -- it's quite recognizable!  What's exceptionally strange is that when I installed 1.6 this morning, it let me configure the Floater -- the same one I can't kill! -- but when I selected to turn the Floater off, again it refused.  I did run the uninstaller before searching my hard drive -- (I just ran another uninstall, btw, from the installer of 1.6, no dice).  This is insane.  As I mentioned before, I've been using Synergy since it was beta, would that have anything to do with this?</p>

<blockquote><p>No, the beta wouldn't have anything to do with it. Why don't you get in touch with me via email so that you can give me some more diagnostic information?</p>
