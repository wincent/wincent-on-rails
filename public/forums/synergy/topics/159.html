<blockquote><p>I'm not sure if I entirely understand your question, but if you mean that you'd like to pay for a license for Synergy Advance but also receive a Synergy license to use while waiting for Synergy Advance to hit 1.0 that can be arranged.</p>
<p>If that is the case, go ahead with the Synergy Advance purchase and then [ulr=<a href="http://wincent.com/a/contact/mail/" class="external">http://wincent.com/a/contact/mail/</a>]contact me[/url] and let me know; I'll generate an interim Synergy license for you and send it via email.</p>

<blockquote><p>To clarify what I ment: For Synergy I only see the option for 5-licenses or 10-licenses, I would prefer Synergy right now because it is a solid build fully functional. However both options are expensive for me. I only own 1 Mac(MPB) and my paypal is in canadian money. So in anticipation for &quot;Synergy Advance&quot; official release, I guess thats 1.0.  (which i know i will want to upgrade to) Is there a cheaper option to purchase 1 license for Synergy.</p>
<p>However from what your saying to me, I should just purchase 1 Synergy Advance, and you'll give me a Synergy license until Synergy Advanced is released. Then Once Synergy Advance is published I will be given a Synergy Advanced serial?</p>
<p>Have I gotten it right?</p>

<p>Well, there are already many, many, many Synergy copy-cats out there so it's too late for patents. And being a small, one-man shop I don't think patents are really viable (too expensive to acquire and then defend them). And finally, lots of &quot;bad guys&quot; use software patents for evil, not for good, and so even if you mean to use patents &quot;for good&quot;, you end up tacitly supporting a system that hurts you and all users in the end because it stifles innovation and encourages predatory, litigious &quot;business models&quot;.</p>
<p>As for Apple buying it, they're welcome to make me an offer! But I think Apple generally doesn't buy such things, rather it just makes their own versions of the ideas.</p>
