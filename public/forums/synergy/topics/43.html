<blockquote><p>Just posted this to wincent.org:Quote: I've just released Synergy version 1.3 (full change log here, direct download link here), an update to the popular and elegant iTunes companion.</p>
<p>This release adds a number of features, enhancements and bugfixes, including instant access to a new, online gallery of free Button Sets (there are nearly 50 sets online as of right now), &quot;power user&quot; options to put the floater on the desktop (instead of floating above everything), and a fix for the &quot;disappearing play/pause button&quot; problem when previewing in the iTunes Music Store.</p>
<p>I know that there are pirate numbers floating around out there, but I really need your support if I am to continue developing this and other software. Please consider purchasing a license; licenses are only 5 Euros (about 6 dollars).</p>
<p>I'm also still looking for additional mirror hosts to help bring the bandwidth costs down. As some of you may know, the main wincent.com server is located in Australia, where bandwidth costs are still astronomical (over 10 cents per meg!). I have just paid for additional hosting over in the USA, where things are a bit cheaper. Now, a lot of the images and downloadable files are hosted over there on a machine called &quot;us.wincent.com&quot;. So this now means that I am paying for hosting both in Australia and in the US, but I am hoping that in the long run it might work out cheaper. It is a bit of a gamble because right now the business is in a very precarious situation, thanks to a very bad run lately with respect to piracy.</p>
<p>So I've got the new US mirror now, but Synergy, and my other products like WinSwitch and WinHex still generate many gigs of traffic. If you can provide some space on a well-connected, reliable server, and give me FTP or SFTP access to the appropriate directory so that I can upload new versions, please get in touch with me at <a href="mailto:win@wincent.org" class="mailto">win@wincent.org</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p>Excellent job on Synergy 1.3.  However, although you implemented the button sets outside of the application for easy installing/removal, it does little good if every new version reinstalls all the button sets that I delete.</p>
