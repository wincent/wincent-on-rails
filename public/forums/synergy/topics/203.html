<blockquote><p>Hi Wincent,</p>
<p>I suppose I'll know in a week, but just out of curiosity, did you implement some sort of login retry for Audio Scrobbler in 3.1.1b?</p>
<p>They seem to have changed their policy about being logged in from multiple locations at once, but now I notice that once a week they require a new login (and my machines all run 24/7 so they rarely get the required login). At any rate, once a week I now have to manually go in and check a new checkbox/hit apply/uncheck the checkbox/hit apply to force a new login from Synergy.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance!</p>

<blockquote><p>Not yet, but I think I'll implement it before the next beta comes out.</p>
<p>If you have a log showing what happens when they require a new login (messages printed to the console), please send/post it because it will help me know exactly what'll be required.</p>
<p>In the meantime though, wouldn't it be easier to stop/restart Synergy at least once a week?</p>

<blockquote><p>Well, yes. But I always forget for a couple extra days!  Typically I remember to re-login every 9 days, so by that time I have a huge cached backlog for Synergy to report. And if I quit Synergy, don't I lose the cache?</p>
<p>At any rate, I'll post the log once I get back home tonight.</p>
<p>(I suppose I could make an osascript Synergy-relaunching cronjob? Will have to think about this...)</p>

<blockquote><p>Yes, you do unfortunately lose the cache.</p>
<p>I think when Leopard comes out I will finally drop support for Jaguar and possibly even require Tiger. Then I could easily use Core Data (Tiger-only) to keep a persistent store of that stuff.</p>

<blockquote><p>Ok, I've now implemented an auto-retry in response to receiving a &quot;BADAUTH&quot; from last.fm. It will retry up to three times before giving up. After a successful handshake the failure counter will be reset back to zero. Hopefully this means that you can run Synergy for weeks on end without ever having to manually re-login.</p>
<p>If you'd like to try it out, please check out this nightly build:</p>

<blockquote><p>Well dang, I didn't get to test the fix in time! I appreciate the time you put in, but I have bad news. </p>
<p>Firstly, it appears I lied when I said that last.fm was allowing multiple logins. It's still a factor and I apologize for having concluded otherwise prematurely.</p>
<p>So, I sat down just now at home and realized I have Remote Access so I can do multi-machine testing quite quickly. I RA'd into work and started Synergy 3.1.1 running there. Since home started first, it gets the login and work gets BADAUTH. And it doesn't seem to try 3x--it just says BADAUTH and then starts queuing with the same messages.</p>
