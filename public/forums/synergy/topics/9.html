<blockquote><p>Now, I know we only spent $5 on Synergy, but since Amazon cut off their album cover service, Synergy has become essentially worthless.  I've heard that there's been all sorts of fixes in the works, but there's no official word or timetable, and that's been going on for over a month now...</p>

<blockquote><p>It still does not work and the Synergy page still makes no mention of this. Deceptive advertising makes me want to puke. I paid for the product and enjoyed it up until the point it stopped working and Wincent ran for cover. Shame on your Wincent for not making it clear on the Synergy page that the product no longer works! It doesn't matter if you plan to fix it in the future, purchasers have the right to know.  </p>

<blockquote><p>Unfortunately all this has happened to me at a very bad time; while travelling without a laptop. I've been able to access the Internet in Internet cafes, and I've been posting updates to  wincent.org telling people what's up.</p>
<p>On arriving in Spain, I ordered a laptop from Apple Spain, a special-order job with an international keyboard. This took weeks and weeks to arrive.</p>
<p>Finally, on 4 November it finally came, but with 10.2.7. So since then, I have been waiting for Panther, which I ordered on the same day. Thankfully, the Apple page now says that it has shipped (on 21 November) from the Apple Store Europe (based in Ireland)... so now I am just waiting for that.</p>
<p>Updating the Synergy website wasn't possible from an Internet cafe; all the computers are locked down: you can only run IE, they're all PCs, and there's no SFTP clients. So I had to wait until I got the laptop before I could update the site (I could update wincent.org because that site has a web-based admin interface), but as soon as I did, I put a  notice on the front page advising people why the covers don't work any more.</p>
<p>So please understand that I am doing the best I can to address this issue, but under unfortunate circumstances. I am sorry to the people that consider Synergy &quot;worthless&quot; during this period in which Amazon has cut off access. Needless to say, looking at the feature list, I don't agree. I still think Synergy has a lot to offer. But in any case, I am working on a fix...</p>
<p>To the poster who remarked that it should be possible to edit the developer token, yes, this is definitely true. You should be able to do it in any hex editor. But I am not going to post instructions on how to do this here or anywhere, because it would clearly be an abuse of Amazon's good will on my part. But what you do in your own time is most definitely up to you...</p>
<p>And to those of you patiently waiting, thanks for your patience. I'll send an email out to all registered users when the update is out there... everybody else will have to keep their eye on  the Synergy website or  wincent.org.  </p>

<blockquote><p>I think the sensitivity is around the fact that all of wincent.com  was updated after the Amazon cutoff - updated to include even teases of new products - yet the new synergy web info still makes no mention of the Amazon situation. When I discovered this new info, I assumed the Amazon situation had been fixed, but apparently it hasn't.</p>
<p>What is the status of the online Album art - will Amazon turn you back on, or is there some other provider?</p>
<p>What if, instead of just the image, synergy grabbed the whole page related to the album in question, then  the larger album image - looking more like a page dl than an image poach?   </p>

<blockquote><p>To be precise, all of the pages were updated in the same 24 hour period, after I got my laptop.</p>
<p>I haven't updated the album covers page (<a href="http://synergy.wincent.com/albumCovers.html" class="external">http://synergy.wincent.com/albumCovers.html</a>), nor any of the other &quot;deep&quot; pages on synergy.wincent.com, opting instead to put a notice in the very top left of the  front page (given that in order to get to any of the deeper pages, you have to go through the front page). But given what people are saying here, I may go ahead and update every single page on the site that mentions album covers so that there is a link to the status page. I also think I should update the wincent.com front page (where Synergy appears in the product listing).</p>
<p>Also note that this page on wincent.org was published on 15 October 2003 as soon as I became aware of the problem. Everyone who has emailed me about this issue has also received the following email:</p>

<blockquote><p>Ok, I think I've found out the developer's token and associate id used in Synergy by watching the network traffic in Interarchy.</p>
<p>I think this is the developer's token: D31GYSP62C9C55</p>
<p>And this is the associate ID: synerformacos-20</p>
<p>So in theory you should be able to use a hex editor to find these strings and replace them with something similar. Only problem is they have to be the same number of characters long (I think!).</p>
<p>I then tried watching Clutter's net traffic and it looks like the dev token from Clutter is:</p>
<p>D10XEP2ZV5TOZ4</p>
<p>And the associate ID is:</p>
<p>webservices-20</p>
<p>So, not sure if this will work, because the associate ID from Synergy is 16 characters long, and the one from Clutter is 14... Perhaps will do some experimenting with a hex editor (first of all I have to find the strings in the Synergy executable!) and see if I can get Synergy to work again by sticking in Clutter's keys... perhaps will have to pad out the associate id with two spaces or something... or register my own key!</p>
<p>Anybody else who knows about this stuff, please help!  </p>

<blockquote><p>That's really cheeky, but it works   (Wincent - feel free to delete these posts if they're could cause you trouble).</p>
<p>I can see why they disabled access though - if Synergy doesn't get a result the first time, it keeps running the search request every 5 seconds (even if you turn off the floater), which can't be good for their server.  </p>

<blockquote><p>I can't understand why anyone would think Synergy was 'worthless' without the album cover downloads... I was happily using it before the album cover feature was added, and I even bought it before then (if my memory is right). The hotkeys and the floater alone, even without the album cover art, make for a phenomenal utility.</p>
<p>Just like to say, thanks, wincent, for programming such a great utility (although, just like everyone else, I would appreciate a compatibility update, as soon as it's available).  </p>

<blockquote><p>OMFG, LOL. Whoever posted the first few posts in this thread obviously has like no idea what the real point of Synergy is. I mean, downloading from Amazon is nice, but its absence hardly renders Synergy &quot;unusable&quot;, especially since Synergy will still show covers you already have in its Album Cover folder, and it will still show covers from iTunes.</p>
<p>Whoever posted those insulting comments is extremely ungrateful for all of the hard work you've put into Synergy. </p>
<p>Anyway, I've emailed you multiple times commending you on your great work on Synergy, but I just wanted to thank you again for putting so much time and effort into Synergy. All of us (well, most of us anyway) really appreciate it. Synergy is simply one of the best OS X utilities, and me and many others just cannot live without it anymore. Seriously, iTunes for Windows is seriously hindered just because of the absence of Synergy. </p>
<p>I've been trying out the 1.0a2 beta, and it's been amazing. No problems on mine at all, it's fixed all the Panther bugs for me.</p>
<p>Thanks again!</p>

<blockquote><p>I have to say hotkeys are what did it for me. I was using another app... &quot;hotkey&quot; I think to run apple scripts that controlled itunes. But it was slow and had no floater and in the short and the long synergy (album covers or not) was much better suited to what I wanted. </p>
<p>(Take into note that while &quot;hotkey&quot; was a lot more powerful - it was also much more expensive and all I wanted was a way to control iTunes.)</p>
<p>I hope the developer's trip in spain (didn't sound like he lived there permanently..) went well and I look forward to seeing the next version of synergy with album art retrieval and what ever else he plan on throwing in. Good to some updates.</p>

<blockquote><p>Is Synegy a spinoff?   </p>
<p>Controlling iTunes is all it's about. </p>
<p>The floater is sweet. I have acquired a lot of music that sounds good to me but I never learned the artists and song names so the floater is educational!</p>
<p>The album covers were nice to impress friends (yawn). It was better that they were not in iTunes since that makes the files bigger which means less songs on the iPod.  </p>

<blockquote><p>Wincent,</p>
<p>With all due respect for your hard work on a wonderful piece of software (and at a steal of a price, as well), I have to ask when you're going to fix the album art function?</p>
<p>More specifically, I emailed you months ago about the possibility of adding the ability to do manual additions of art, and I believe you replied that it was in the works. While I agree that Synergy is far from &quot;worthless&quot; without the album art function, it nevertheless is (was) one of the coolest aspects of the program and one I miss a LOT.</p>
<p>Why can't the album art be added at the user's descretion? Is it really hard to implement? There ought to be some way to get around the Amazon issue, and put the control of the feature where it belongs: in the hands of the user!</p>
<p>I hope you can give all of us some sort of response on this. I've been waiting very patiently, but your last post was mid-December and here it is almost February 1st. I just went back and found the response I got from you via email about this, on September 3rd of last year. You wrote:</p>
<p>That kind of functionality is going to be in a point update eg. 1.0.1 or 1.1 or similar.</p>
<p>Are we at ALL close to that point???</p>
<p>Sincerely, John</p>

<blockquote><p>I think that most people who make predictions about when things will be done in the future find their predictions coming back to bite them, and I am definitely no exception!</p>
<p>Right now the Synergy code base is over 40,000 lines of code (which includes a fair bit of in-code documentation) but it's a sizeable project. One of the reasons that the album downloads issue is taking so long to fix is that I am finding that I have to make widespread changes throughout the codebase. Also, the code is fairly strongly wedded to Amazon.com, which means it's not easy to just switch it over to another source. In general I am finding it slow to make changes to Synergy because it has grown far beyond its original purpose. With a bit more foresight I could've saved myself a lot of grief...</p>
<p>Synergy Advance will also have album cover management features, but they will be modular in nature and won't be tied to just Amazon. Of course, this doesn't help the current Synergy situation, which really is a separate issue.</p>
<p>I apologise for the slow progress, but I am working on it. My personal circumstances have changed somewhat of late (moving from one country to another) and that also has affected my development resources, but now I am basically full-time working on this stuff (at least until my savings run out!).</p>
<p>My time is currently divided into three parts: firstly, maintaining customer relations (responding to emails, reading feedback, processing payments, admin stuff, website maintenance); secondly, working on updates to existing Wincent products; and thirdly, working on future Wincent products.</p>
<p>In terms of the latter, I'm 95% done working on a replacement for Apple's Fast User Switching menu that doesn't take up so much screen real-estate, and the rest of my time goes into developing a framework called WOBase which is at heart not only of Synergy Advance, but GetSmart Pro and just about every other software project I have in mind for the future. The framework is up and running, functional and already useful (in fact, it's in my WinHex application which has already been released to the public). I'm not going to make any predictions about when the other apps will be ready for release though, although I can say that it is my intention to release early and often in the beginning stages (ie. at version 0.1) so that you can get lots of snapshots of how things are progressing.</p>
