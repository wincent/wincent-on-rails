<blockquote><p>I read the thread with debugging info &amp; a link to a new build to address winserverui hanging. I installed that build and am still seing problems with winserverui being hung. </p>
<p>Most of the time it doesn't seem to affect anything, I can use the menu items. But twice now it has gotten into a state where as soon as I move the mouse over the system menu, I'll get the spinning beach ball cursor.</p>
<p>The following is appearing in the console... what else can I provide for troubleshooting?</p>

<blockquote><p>We need to be clear on our terminology here to avoid confusion. This bug report about SystemUIServer is about crashes:</p>
<p><a href="http://wincent.com/a/support/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=68" class="external">http://wincent.com/a/support/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=68</a></p>
<p>But you're talking about &quot;hanging&quot;. In my book, a &quot;crash&quot; is when an application goes boom and stops running. ie. one minute it's there, and the next minute, boom, it's gone. A &quot;hang&quot;, in contrast, is when an app continues to run, but when you can't do any useful work with it because it's beachballing. Sometimes a hung application can get unstuck, but in many cases you could leave it running forever and it would never recover; it would just keep on beachballing.</p>
<p>So the build referred to in <a href="/issues/68">bug #68</a> (which fixes a crashing issue), shouldn't really have any bearing at all on a hanging issue.</p>
<p>As for the console output, most of it looks normal to me. The system will always complain about being unable to load &quot;MenuCracker.menu&quot;. This is a necessary part of the process of getting the system to accept third-party menu extras. Then you see WinSwitch getting loaded normally.</p>
<p>The &quot;Could not get menu extra&quot; lines indicate a time out is occurring. Basically, whenever a new menu extra is added to the menu bar, WinSwitchHelper makes sure that it wasn't the Apple Fast User Switching menu that got added (and if it was, it displays a helpful notification dialog explaining why there are two Fast User Switching menus visible at the same time!). Those -4956 errors indicate timeouts when WinSwitchHelper is asking the system whether the Apple Fast User Switching menu is present. If these timeouts are occurring often, I suspect something fishy is bogging down your system, or there's some other incompatibility that's causing the time out.</p>
<p>The last line has nothing to do with WinSwitch, but must be generated by some other menu extra installed on your system. You should probably post a list of menu extras that you are using.</p>

<blockquote><p>When I say hang, this is what I mean....  If I use the Activity Monitor to view the running processes, the line showing SystemUIServer will turn red, and instead of just saying &quot;SystemUIServer&quot;, it says &quot;SystemUIServer (Hung)&quot;</p>
<p>Once when this happened, things were in a state such that when I moved my mouse to the system menu area, I would get the spinning wheel. Most of the time though, the menu still seems to work, even though the SystemUIServer is showing as Hung in the application monitor</p>
