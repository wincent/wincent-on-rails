<blockquote><p>Hi, I tried to install gVim 7.3 (official windows final build win32 on 32bit XP SP3 machine) which is built against Ruby 1.9.1 with the latest version of Command T. However when I attempt to open a file with Command T I get an error an unhandled win32 exception occurred in gvim.exe 8236. </p>
<p>I used the devkit 3.4.5 and the install seemed to go through without issue.</p>
<p>I had originally tried using Ruby 1.8.7 but with this I got the message that I needed to take a version of vim that is compiled against Ruby (probably as it now uses a higher version). 1.9.1 would be better as this is what we are using at work anyway but if I had to use 1.8.7 I guess I'd need to revert to gvim 7.2</p>
<p>Do you have any idea what could be causing this? Kind Regards, Crocked</p>

<blockquote><p>I've tried various combinations of Vim and Ruby on Windows (Windows XP to be precise), and the only one which I could get working reliably was the one mentioned in the readme (Vim 7.2 from www.vim.org, Ruby 1.8.7, and the 3.4.5 devkit).</p>
<p>I'm not a Windows expert (my desktop runs Mac OS X) so I don't really know what would need to be done to get Vim 7.3 and/or Ruby 1.9.x playing nicely with Command-T.</p>

<blockquote><p>I downloaded a recent build of the Windows VIM 7.3 from <a href="http://wyw.dcweb.cn/" class="external">http://wyw.dcweb.cn/</a> and used that in combination with Ruby 1.9.2 (which has a 191 dll) to fix my crash issues in combination with CommandT. The VIM binary from vim.org has Ruby-related bugs that have been fixed in later versions for which no new binary exists on the vim.org site, unfortunately. </p>

<blockquote><p>FYI,</p>
<p>Standard Vim 73_46 exes for Windows (from <a href="http://www.vim.org/download.php#pc" class="external">http://www.vim.org/download.php#pc</a>) have the crashing issue with Ruby 1.9.x, but require 1.9.x.</p>
<p>Instead, you can use Wu Yongwei's build of Vim for Windows (currently 7.3.393) which include the fixes to the Ruby crash.  Go here and grab the vim73.zip from <a href="http://wyw.dcweb.cn/#download" class="external">http://wyw.dcweb.cn/#download</a> and copy it to your standard vim install.  His zip doesn't include the runtime so you should install the standard vim first.</p>

<blockquote><p>Wincent,</p>
<p>I want to thank you for creating this awesome plugin. It has been a tremendous productivity boon. I was able to get Command-T to work based on the instructions in the documentation. Though I could not find a way to make it work with 7.3</p>
<p>Today, I finally cracked the nut.</p>
<p>Here's the step by step guide:</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/SolutionYogi/VimSetup/blob/master/software/README.txt" class="external">https://github.com/SolutionYogi/VimSetup/blob/master/software/README.txt</a></p>
<p>[I have stored all associated installation packages in <a href="https://github.com/SolutionYogi/VimSetup/tree/master/software" class="external">https://github.com/SolutionYogi/VimSetup/tree/master/software</a> ]</p>
<p>I am now a super happy user of Vim 7.3 (Persistent Undo FTW!) and Command-T. </p>
