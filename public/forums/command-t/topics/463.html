<blockquote><p>Hi there,</p>
<p>first of all thank you for the amazing vim plugin. I've got a little problem with my setup that is maybe somehow fixable.</p>
<p>I store all of my config files (dotfiles) on my dropbox so every machine that I use stays up to date with all the changes. The dotfiles include my .vimrc and whole .vim directory. The problem I have is that command-t requires some binary files that need to be compiled for a specific machine and hence do not work on (Mac and Debian). Whenever I need to use command-t I have to remember to go to the bundle folder and recompile the binaries. Is there a way to store the binaries in a different location? Or do you have any experience with this kind of problems and could give me a suggestion on how to fix them myself.</p>
<p>Thanks, Janusz</p>

<blockquote><p>I personally just recompile as I tend not to switch machines too often, but I guess you could build multiple executables in different subdirectories, store them in version control, and then hack the <code>plugin/command-t.vim</code> and perhaps some other files in the plugin to make it dynamically pick the right extension depending on what architecture you're running on at runtime.</p>
<p>This wouldn't be something I could ever feasibly support though officially, so you'd be own your own in that sense.</p>

<blockquote><p>Hi Wincent,</p>
<p>thanks for your help. If anyone needs this kind of thing to work you just have to copy the ruby directory to something called ruby_ARCH and create different libs in each of those directories - you don't have to hack any of the plugin code. Or at least I didn't have to :)</p>
<p>Thanks again, Janusz</p>
