<blockquote><p>Yes, bring up Command-T with the window in which you'd like to open the file already active; that way Command-T will open the file up in that window.</p>
<p>Command-T will never use any &quot;special&quot; buffer (such as NERDTree, MiniBufExplorer etc) for opening a file, and will always split in that case, to avoid replacing the contents of the &quot;special&quot; buffer. (And not only that, but such buffers are usually an undesirable shape for editing anyway, like NERDTree which is tall and thin, or MiniBufExplorer which is short and wide.)</p>
<p>The alternative would be for Command-T to use some other window in that case, but there is no non-arbitrary way for it to select which buffer to use (ie. if you have 2 or 3 &quot;non-special&quot; buffers available, which one should be used? No matter which one Command-T chooses it will seem unintuitive or wrong to at least some users at least some of the time).</p>

<blockquote><p>Interesting. The reason I bring this up is that I often:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>cd ~/src/project</code></li>
<li><code>mvim .</code></li>
<li>leader-t to the file I want to edit</li>
</ul>
<p>This leaves me in an undesired split state.</p>

<blockquote><p>Seems that the <code>mvim .</code> is kind of redundant seeing as it is going to show you a list of files/directories that you are then going to ignore and use a different means of selecting a file to open (Command-T).</p>
<p>The way I generally work is, at the start of a session, just <code>:cd ~/src/project</code> inside Vim (ie. with an empty window) and go from there.</p>
<p>If you don't like this workflow and want to continue doing <code>mvim .</code> and find yourself with an unwanted split, about all I can think of is that you do <code>:on</code> to get rid of the split.</p>

<blockquote><p>If you're using NERDTree, you can get this to work by automatically opening an empty buffer alongside the NERDTree pane so Command-T has a regular buffer to work with. To preserve expected default behavior, this only works if you open a directory as the single argument to vim.</p>
<p>Put this in <code>after/plugins/nerd_tree_command-t.vim</code>:</p>
<pre>
&quot; NERDTree and Command-T compatibility hack
&quot;
&quot; open an empty buffer and then start a real nerdtree, but only if
&quot; vim was opened with a single directory as the first argument.
&quot; The empty buffer gives command-t a buffer in which to open a
&quot; file, rather than having it fail to clobber the default directory browser.
&quot;
&quot; This preserves the NERDTree netrw browsing replacement, but hacks it
&quot; when vim is first loading.
&quot;
&quot; This script is in after/plugins since it needs to add the autocmd
&quot; hijacking overrides after the plugin itself has been initialized.

function ReplaceNERDTreeIfDirectory()
  if argc() == 1 &amp;&amp; isdirectory(argv(0))
    &quot; replace the directory browser with an empty buffer
    enew
    &quot; and open a regular nerdtree instead
    NERDTree
  end
endfunction

augroup NERDTreeHijackNetrw
  au VimEnter * call ReplaceNERDTreeIfDirectory()
augroup END
