<blockquote><p>Hi there,</p>
<p>CommandT is great, just what I was looking for. Except for one thing: would it be possible to make it flush the cached file list automatically when a file is created or deleted? Invoking :CommandTFlush every time is bit annoying.</p>

<blockquote><p>This could probably be added as an option, but it wouldn't default to being on because the speed hit when having to rescan a large project with thousands of files would be unacceptable.</p>
<p>I imagine there are some autocmds that could be hooked in to when new files are created from within Vim, and that's what would have to be used here. Perhaps <code>BufNewfile</code> or <code>BufWritePost</code>.</p>
<p>Files created outside of Vim (eg. on the command line) can't be efficiently automatically detected in any kind of platform-independent way, so that would leave polling, which has to be ruled out too because it would be quite resource intensive.</p>
<p>One thing you could do in the meantime is bind <code>:CommandTFlush</code> to something that is easier for you to invoke, like <code>&lt;Leader&gt;ctf</code> or whatever.</p>

<blockquote><p>Is there a possibility to invoke the flush from the outside... say a bash script? The cache has to be flushed whenever I perform a git checkout or git pull and it would be helpful to tie those commands together.</p>

<blockquote><p>Not sure, to be honest, as I've never tried it.</p>
<p>You have two options, I think:</p>
<p>One is to check the <a href="/wiki/Vim">Vim</a> man page and see if any of the options will allow you to send a command to an existing Vim instance; these ones look promising:</p>
<pre>       --remote    Connect to a Vim server and make it edit the files given in the  rest  of  the  arguments.   If  no
                   server is found a warning is given and the files are edited in the current Vim.

       --remote-expr {expr}
                   Connect to a Vim server, evaluate {expr} in it and print the result on stdout.

       --remote-send {keys}
                   Connect to a Vim server and send {keys} to it.

       --remote-silent
                   As --remote, but without the warning when no server is found.

       --remote-wait
                   As --remote, but Vim does not exit until the files have been edited.

       --remote-wait-silent
                   As --remote-wait, but without the warning when no server is found.

       --serverlist
                   List the names of all Vim servers that can be found.

       --servername {name}
                   Use  {name}  as  the  server name.  Used for the current Vim, unless used with a --remote argument,
                   then it's the name of the server to connect to.</pre>
<p>The other is to do your <a href="/wiki/Git">Git</a> operations from inside Vim itself (for example, using Tim Pope's <a href="/wiki/fugitive.vim">fugitive.vim</a>), in which case you can fairly easily add mappings to do both the Git operation and the Command-T flush in one hit.</p>
