<blockquote><p>I'm using MacVim (VIM - Vi IMproved 7.3 (2010 Aug 15, compiled Aug 15 2010 22:03:01)) on Mac OS X (10.7.2).</p>
<p>I'm trying to search some folders and it won't search directory named &quot;webservices-analytics&quot;. Even if I set path to parent directory of this one, and there's only one sibling, command-t still treats this directory as if it isn't there. The directory in question contains small Rails project.</p>
<p>I didn't have any problem with installation, although I did use small script called &quot;unball.py&quot; to extract vba file (command-t-1.3.vba). I put extracted result in bundle directory, as I'm using Pathogen.</p>
<p>I've used this unball script few times before, and it didn't result in any problems. As it has less then 50 lines, I can paste it if that would help. (I got this script from somebody's git .vim directory, unfortunately I don't recall more details.)</p>
<p>Weird thing is that Command-t seems to be working for all other directories. (but then again, I've installed Command-t yesterday, so I haven't tested it that much)</p>
<p>If it's important, I'm using a few plugins: Pathogen, TagBar, Gundo, NERDTree, Snipmate, Conque Shell, SuperTab, NERDCommenter, Rainbow (modified), MRU, EasyMotion, LustyJuggler, Pydoc, PyFlakes, pep8</p>
<p>Any idea what could be the problem? Command-t seems like a promising plugin and I would love to use it. I hope this hiccup is on my side or something easily fixable.</p>

<p>If you're using <a href="/wiki/Pathogen">Pathogen</a>, you may as well install <a href="/wiki/Command-T">Command-T</a> by cloning the <a href="/wiki/Git">Git</a> repo to <code>~/.vim/bundle/command-t</code>. The benefit of this is that you avoid the known flakiness of the Vimball system (random omission when extracting files), and updating becomes a simple matter of doing a <code>git pull</code>.</p>
<p>As to your problem with finding files, my best guess is that the directory hierarchy you're in has more than <code>g:CommandTMaxFiles</code> files in it (defaults to 10,000, overrideable in your <code>~/.vimrc</code>) or your <a href="/wiki/Vim">Vim</a> <code>'wildignore'</code> setting is excluding the directory. Both of these topics are covered in the docs.</p>

<blockquote><p>Thank you Wincent, this MaxFiles variable solved problem. :)</p>
<p>I've only used command-t couple a dozen of times, but it's really useful. So thank you for making this great plugin.</p>
