<blockquote><p>Hello,</p>
<p>I've just installed Command-T and I love it. What about extending it by the possibilty to navigate to function definitions (via ctags), open buffers and so on?</p>
<p>Best regards</p>

<blockquote><p>Well, initially one of the guiding design philosophies was to do <em>one</em> thing (file navigation) and do it really well, but I think at least in the case of buffer navigation there is a strong case to be made that buffer navigation is actually just a special case of file navigation ie. you're (mostly) navigating open files.</p>
<p>So I am open to adding this and there is already a request for buffer navigation in the issue tracker: see <a href="/issues/1608">ticket #1608</a>.</p>
<p>As for tags, that one hasn't been requested yet. I'm not a heavy tags user myself so I probably won't be the one to implement it, but if somebody wants to submit a patch or two for it I'd be happy to take a look at it/them. I've added a placeholder ticket in the issue tracker for this: <a href="/issues/1746">ticket #1746</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p>Hi,</p>
<p>If files were sorted in this priority:</p>
<ol>
<li>last accessed ( acessed before the buffer you're currently in ) </li>
<li>files that are open buffers </li>
<li>all other files</li>
</ol>
<p>Command-t would be the one plugin to rule them all.</p>
<p>So if you invoked cmd-t list and if you didnt type anything you'd see a list of open buffers. </p>
<p>Typing &lt;leader&gt;t &lt;cr&gt; would take you to the last file you were working on.</p>
<p>This is how command-t in textmate works, which is a huge timesaver for switching between files. </p>
<p>Also I believe this would also fit within your criteria of doing file navigation exceptionally well as well as it would take care of buffer navigation in a very elegant manner.</p>
