<blockquote><p>Now that I can get 0.4 to launch, it certainly sucks a lot less than the previous versions ;-)</p>
<p>I can't seem to find anything in the known issues or bug database about Synergy Advance not using Classic's album art folder (i.e. I have no album art displayed) - presumably this is on the to-do list?</p>

<blockquote><p>Glad to hear you think it sucks less! I expect it to suck even less in the future.</p>
<p>Synergy Advance uses plug-ins to obtain album art. The basic, built-in support just asks iTunes for the art (incidentally, iTunes support itself is also implemented via a plug-in, opening the way up for supporting different players with different plug-ins).</p>
<p>To the best of my knowledge, this release is the last of the major changes the &quot;plumbing&quot; of Synergy Advance (ie. I don't foresee the need to make any major changes in the depths of the engine), and that means that I can now spend a lot more time on the frilly stuff that gets layered on top. I know that it's precisely the &quot;frilly stuff&quot; that users are most interested in (ie. features), but it's important to have a good foundation.</p>
<p>In any case, a plug-in for pulling album art out of the folder that Synergy has already downloaded is on that list. It should be very easy to do, less than a day's work, so expect it soon. The only hold-up is that before I can release the plug-in I need to finish the plug-in management user interface so that users can turn plug-ins on and off and change the order in which they have effect (this will enable you to prioritise album art sources: different Amazon country branches, stuff downloaded by Synergy, stuff obtained from iTunes etc).</p>

<blockquote><p>Frillyness is where it's at I'm afraid.</p>
<p>I think 0.4 shows a lot more promise in terms of where things are headed; I can certainly use it without having to have Classic running which is an advantage.  I also like how the visual feedback from hotkeys has been cleaned up; both visually and in terms of responsiveness.</p>
<p>I'm fairly close to upgrading my license </p>
<p>One thing that does concern me is how many items are in the menu item; it looks a little *too* advanced.  Maybe it would be worth thinking of ways to retain the functionality but reduce the visual footprint - as with Safari's download manager for instance.</p>

<blockquote><p>One way in which I've tried to hide as much detail as possible is by using the Option key as a modifier to hide alternate menu items.</p>
<p>I plan to add full customizability to the Global Menu, much in the same way that you can customize Unsanity's FruitMenu and quite a few other utilities. My basic idea is to allow you to add/remove/rearrange menu items in the Global Menu via drag and drop. To keep informed of progress towards this goal, see this feature request:</p>
