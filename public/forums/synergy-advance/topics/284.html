<blockquote><p>Hi, I purchased Synergy Advance and like many of the features it will offer however playlists are working/not working and are totally wierd.</p>
<p>The whole point of playlists is to allow you to play a set of songs you like.  Synergy Advance allows me to see and select a song from a playlist and it will start playing (most of the time... sometimes this doesn't even work!).  This is great.  Exactly what I wanted (when it works of course).</p>
<p>My keyboard has function keys that iTunes works with to play/pause/skip track etc.  When I use the play/pause button play will pause.  But then I hit it again, instead of being in the playlist I was in, Synergy Advance will jump out of the playlist and into some some probably in library order.  This is bad!</p>
<p>Also when I select a song in a playlist I expect iTunes to keep playing from that playlist.  When it is selected from Synergy Advance it plays that one song then stops.</p>

<p>This is a bug in iTunes, but Synergy Advance provides a work around that can be used to avoid the bug:</p>

<p>Quote:Also when I select a song in a playlist I expect iTunes to keep playing from that playlist.  When it is selected from Synergy Advance it plays that one song then stops.</p>
<p>I'll have to look into this one. When you select a song from a playlist in Synergy Advance, Synergy Advance sends iTunes a request of the form, &quot;Play track X of playlist Y&quot;. I wrote it that way because I basically expected iTunes to &quot;do the right thing&quot; with such a request.</p>
<p>It sounds like what you want Synergy Advance to do is send a slightly different command (two commands, actually), of the form, &quot;Switch to playlist Y and then play track X&quot;.</p>
<p>I think that for many people the latter behaviour may be more intuitive, but it should be a user-settable preference because there will certainly be others that will prefer the existing behaviour.</p>
<p>I will open a feature request for this in the database:</p>
