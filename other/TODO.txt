acts_as_rateable
"was this article helpful for you?":
- yes, very helpful
- somewhat helpful
- no, not helpful

data importers from bugzilla, UBB.threads etc
- importing users should be relatively easy
- harder will be importing posts, comments etc due to ordering issues
- MT is easy, just copy static files
- MediaWiki may be easy, depending on how deltas are stored
  (if need be can just do the static thing again)

do I need to support multiple weblogs?
- on the old site I had news, personal, mini-log, quicklinks, git-log,
  nightlies log
- on the new site it may be simpler to just have one weblog
- and add separate model/controller for git-log (basically have to do
  that anyway because it won't use wikitext markup)
- mini-log, not sure if it can go away
- quicklinks most definitely can go away as it is effectively abandoned
- might replace mini-log with twitter model and controller
- nightlies is essential, not sure what to do with that
- and not sure whether the separation of the news and personal
  weblogs is essential or not

comments on wiki articles:
- better might be the "rateable" idea above with optional feedback textarea

wikitext cheatsheet:
- should mention that bug #12 in PRE or similar can get pretty ugly
- the solution is to use an entity: &#x0023; for the hash

UI bug:
- if you mark a blog post as non-public there is no way to get to its edit page
- but it's not really non-public: it's just omitted from the index
- you can get to it by navigating to the URL

Bug:
- try to create wiki article and fail validation, any tags you set won't appear in the form

full-text search:
- still not convinced that I am doing this the right way
- acts_as_sphinx looks like the best contender
- but i am not sure about access control in that case; can sphinx handle that?
- i guess I just have to test this thing in the staging environment with a _lot_ of data

events:
- add "Event" model
- will record things like "user created", "confirmation sent" etc
- probably using Observers
- for admin only
- will provide an overview of what's been happening
- alert me to possible abuse

get signup email working:
- first signup
- then password forgotten
- we don't want to reset the password because some attacker guesses somebody else's email
- we want to generate a token that is valid for short period (1 hour?)
- and they visit the link
- and can enter a new password

mailing list imports:
- list model
- user has many lists through subscriptions
