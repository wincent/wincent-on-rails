"was this article helpful for you?":
- yes, very helpful
- somewhat helpful
- no, not helpful

data importers from bugzilla, UBB.threads etc
- importing users should be relatively easy
- harder will be importing posts, comments etc due to ordering issues
- MT is easy, just copy static files
- MediaWiki may be easy, depending on how deltas are stored
  (if need be can just do the static thing again)

do I need to support multiple weblogs?
- on the old site I had news, personal, mini-log, quicklinks, git-log,
  nightlies log
- on the new site it may be simpler to just have one weblog
- and add separate model/controller for git-log (basically have to do
  that anyway because it won't use wikitext markup)
- mini-log, not sure if it can go away
- quicklinks most definitely can go away as it is effectively abandoned
- might replace mini-log with twitter model and controller
- nightlies is essential, not sure what to do with that
- and not sure whether the separation of the news and personal
  weblogs is essential or not

comments on wiki articles:
- better might be the "rateable" idea above with optional feedback textarea

wikitext cheatsheet:
- should mention that bug #12 in PRE or similar can get pretty ugly
- the solution is to use an entity: &#x0023; for the hash
