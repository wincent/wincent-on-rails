Shopping Cart Icon

October 20, 2006

The other day I was working on an icon for an online shop. However at the end
it turned out that we don't need it. So I thought it would be a good idea to
share it with you guys, instead of leaving it getting dusty somewhere in a
folder.

So if you are ever in the situation that you need an icon for your online shop,
feel free to use it. Most likely just need the PNG versions, however I also
included icon resources for Mac, Windows and Linux. You never know :)
