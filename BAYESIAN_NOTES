Whitespace always separates tokens.

SPAM DATABASE

Need to track words, how many spam messages they appear in (not how many times they appear), and total spam count

HAM DATABASE

Do we need one? I think we just combine the others:

SUPPORT TICKET DATABASE
FEATURE REQUEST DATABASE
etc

Could store this in a single database table in reality, I think. In fact, could even combine the spam database as well. Note that words can appear in all categories (ie. "free" could appear as a spam word and a support ticket word).
