- simplify and reduce the number of links in the main navbar
  - "Services", for example, can go
  - shorten "Knowledge Base" to "Wiki"
  - remove "Contact" (move into "Support")





External links:

<a href="foo" class="external">here is a link <span>(external link)</span></a>

/* only browsers which don't support CSS will see the "external link" text */
a.external span { display:none; }

/* browsers which support CSS will see an icon */
a.external {
  background: url(icon.png) no-repeat 100% 0;
  padding: 0 20px 0 0;
  }

Will write a helper to make this easier
