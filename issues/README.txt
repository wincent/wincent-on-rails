This is a little experimental subdirectory to give me a playground in which to
experiment with React. Additionally, I'll be using Node so that I can share
rendering code across client and server. I might end up using Backbone as the
glue for all of this but I am not sure yet.

The goal here is to build up a subset of the current issue tracker functionality
(and perhaps one day a superset), as it is the most complex part of the current
application and the closest to being like a "single page application" in its
requirements.
