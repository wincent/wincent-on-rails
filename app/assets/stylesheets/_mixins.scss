// As we're taking a "mobile first" approach, the default styles apply to small

// This is the opposite of the typical breakpoint approach, where items are
// hidden or overridden as the screen gets smaller. We're not doing that because
// we want to encourage "mobile first" thinking, and also, free the
// resource-constrained mobile devices to not have to worry about parsing and
// calculating all those overrides.
